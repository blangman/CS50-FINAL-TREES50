                            of years!</strong>
                        The leaves of the ginkgo tree are extremely distinct from other leaves, having a wonderful fan
                        shape
                        to them. In addition to their speical shape, ginkgo leaves have an amazing history behind them.
                        The leaves of
                        ginkgo trees were found fossilized from as far back as 200 million years ago! That's back when
                        dinosaurs walked the earth
                        and this tree has remain largely unchanged since then! These leaves are also famous for the
                        bright yellow color that
                        they turn in the fall, which lights up the entire tree.

                        A young Ginkgo tree has gray bark which is rather smooth. As the tree ages, not only does the
                        bark
                        become more deeply furrowed, but the color also changes. Older Ginkgo trees have a browner bark
                        color than
                        their younger counterparts. The wood of Ginkgos is extremely weak, which makes it an almost
                        worthless tree commercially.

                        Female Ginkgo Trees produce berries, which are how the tree reproduces. But, once these berries
                        fall to the ground
                        they start emitting a foul smell, which can be described as smelling like rotting flesh! The
                        reason why
                        these berries release this smell is because it attracts carnivorous animals to eat the berries
                        and then once the berries
                        are consumed, the seeds will be pooped out by the animals in another place and thus allows for
                        the tree to
                        reproduce! And, since this tree has been around since the time of dinosaurs, you can imagine
                        that some of those
                        predators that have been attracted to the smell of ginkgo berries were dinosaurs themselves!

                        Yes, you read that correctly, trees can have hair! If you look closely on the edge of the
                        European Beech,
                        you can see small hair follicles surrounding the entire leaf. These little hairs serve as a
                        defense mechanism for
                        the tree to fend off against predators. For small insects, these little hairs serve essentially
                        as barbs that have the
                        ability to get them stuck to the leaf and therefore be vulnerable to predators, and for larger
                        predators,
                        these hairs are annoying and irritating in their mouth, which serves as a reminder to not eat
                        that leaf anymore.

                        European Beech Trees are extremely famous because of their smooth and delicate bark. The bark
                        is very thin, which means many things for the tree. For one, European Beeches are extremely
                        popular
                        among young lovers because it is the perfect tree to carve your name on in a heart, which is
                        done a lot.
                        But, it also the thinness and delicacy of the bark is harmful because it can lead to the bark
                        being damaged more
                        easily than most species of trees.

                        their full teardrop shape.

                        The Common Hawthorn leaf could be categorized as both a lobed leaf and also as a pointed leaf.
                        The overall shape
                        of the leaf is very similar to most of the Maples that we have seen, yet the leaf does not have
                        many points that deine it.
                        Instead of points, each segment of the leaf is curved rather than pointed, which puts this leaf
                        in the miscellaneous categories.

                        Similar to the rest of the oak family, the Scarlet Oak develops furrows as it ages. But, unlike
                        other
                        species in the family, these furrows are not very deep and instead remain rather close to the
                        surface.
                        The inner bark between the furrows is a pink color when the tree is young, and as the tree ages
                        this
                        inner bark turns orange.

                        The Scarlet Oak has adapted to grow in dry environments. The tree can grow along ridges and
                        slopes with
                        an elaborate root system. Because of this extensive root system, it means several things for the
                        tree:
                        For one, the tree is much harder to uproot because of it's ability to grow along ridges. For
                        another thing,
                        the Scarlet Oak is able to survive droughts much better than other trees because its elaborate
                        trunk allows
                        for optimal water storage.

                        The leaves of the Pin Oak are very similar to those of the Scarlet Oak, only they are
                        simpler. Pin Oak leaves mostly have 5 lobes, all of which are pointed. Also similar to
                        the Scarlet Oak, the gaps between lobes in the Pin Oak are very drastic, meaning that the
                        biggest
                        distinction comes with the amount of lobes on the leaf.

                        When the Pin Oak is young, the bark is extremely soft and smooth. As the tree grows, the
                        bark begins to grow furrows, but unlike oaks like the Red Oak or White Oak, the Pin Oak
                        never gets deep furrows, only growing deep enough to make small lines in the bark, but the
                        bark itself stays rather smooth.

                        <strong>The Pin Oak is a tree of many names. </strong>
                        The name Pin Oak derives from the fact that when Pin Oak branches are young, they are extremely
                        sharp and durable, which is the reverse of most trees, which start their branches off as weak,
                        soft wood. But, while this is the common name, the Pin Oak is also known as the Swamp Oak (Not
                        to be
                        confused with White Swamp Oak), the Water Oak, or the Spanish Oak for its ability to grow in wet
                        and swampy
                        environments.
