    Another very common type of leaf in Harvard Yard is pointed leaves! These leaves are distinguishable 
    by their star-like shapes and sharp edges. Pointed leaves are one of the biggest categories of leaves

              in what soil the Sweetgum is grown in, the leaves of the tree can either turn yellow or red in the fall.

                <strong>The Red Maple leaf is one of the most iconic leaves in North America.</strong>
                The Red Maple leaf is a very popular symbol, especially if you have ever seen the map of Canada.
                Another example of this leaf being popular is the NHL team the Toronto Maple Leaves. This leaf been
                the symbol of Canada since the 1800s. This leaf has three primary points with two smaller points 
                on the bottom of the leaf. Within each point of the leaf, there are several points. The leaf became such 
                a popular symbol because of the Red Maple's many uses from timber to syrup and many uses in between.

              Up until now, most of the trees that have scaly bark have furrows that cause individual "scales" on the tree.

              allows the tree, when grown next to other Hedge Maples, to be created into artistic hedges. Other trees when 
              they are pruned suffer greatly and don't have strong enough defenses to be able to regrow the parts that they lost, but the

              <strong>The Dawn Redwood has needles that are arranged in a leaf-like pattern. </strong>
              The needles of the Dawn Redwood are small individually, growing to only about 1 inch in length. 
              The way that the needles grow is in a perfectly symmetrical fashion, with equal needles growing on 
              either side of the branch that holds them. These needles then create a leaf shape which creates an illusion
              where if you look at a dawn redwood from a distance, you can't tell that it has needles. These needles aren't like any 
              ordinary needles also! Unlike most conifers, the Dawn Redwood needles actually change color to a beautiful red 
              and drop in the fall, making it one of only a handful of deciduous conifers!

              As the name suggests, the bark of the dawn Redwood is red! But, in addition to being red, the 
              bark of this tree is also flaky. When the bark flakes off, the wood underneath it is also a red 
              color and is extremely smooth. This then creates a cycle of flaking bark off and regrowing that bark back.

              <strong>The Dawn Redwood was thought to be extinct for a long time until it was rediscovered!</strong> 
              The Dawn Redwood was a tree that scientists had found in the fossil record in China that was thought 
              to be extinct for close to 5 million years. That was until a Chinese forester found one in a forest 
              in the Sichuan Province of China. Another fun fact: The forester who found the thought-to-be-endangered Dawn Redwood 
              had worked at Harvard's very own Arnold Arboretum, and do you know the very first place in the western world that Dawn Redwood seeds were sent?
              You guessed it, it was Harvard! This history is so special that Harvard's Arnold Arboretum actually uses the 
              Dawn Redwood as it's symbol.

              <strong>The Western Larch has distinct needles that become even more distinct in the fall! </strong>
              The needles of a Western Larch grow up to 2 inches long and grow in clumps of between 15 to 30. 
              In each clump, the needles form a cone shape facing away from the branch. In the fall, the needles of the 
              Western Larch turn a bright yellow color, as seen in the image beneath the name. The Western Larch, like the 
              Dawn Redwood, is one of only a handful of trees that are deciduous conifers where the needles change color and fall in 
              autumn.

              <strong> The bark of the Western Larch is scaly and flaky. </strong>
              The bark of the Western Larch is deeply fissured and flaky as the tree gets old. 
              When the bark flakes off, it reveals the deep orange wood underneath. The bark of the tree 
              is also very thick, which makes the tree very resistant to fire.

              <strong>The Western Larch serves as an important host for all kinds of wildlife. </strong> 
              The seeds of the Western Larch are a prized food source for many animals such as woodpeckers and other 
              birds. Western Larches when they are also fully grown have been found to be nesting places for Bald Eagles 
              and other large predatory birds like hawks and eagles.
