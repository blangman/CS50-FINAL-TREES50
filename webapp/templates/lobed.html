              <strong>The Leaf of the Red Oak has pointed lobes.</strong>
              The lobes of the leaf refers to the different compartments of the leaf that appear to be protruding out.
              In the Red Oak, these lobes are pointed. Normally, there are between 7 to 11 lobes on each leaf of a Red Oak,
              and these leaves can vary in size, with large leaves growing up to 9 inches long!

              Red Oak bark is usually (unsurprisingly) red in color but has lines of silver that run through the bark.
              As the tree ages, fisures form which appear as "cracks" in the tree. These cracks contribute to the scaly
              appearance of the Red Oak.
