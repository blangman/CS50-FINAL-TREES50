            <strong> The Leaf of the Red Oak has pointed lobes.</strong>
            The lobes of the leaf refers to the different compartments of the leaf that appear to be protruding out.
            In the Red Oak, these lobes are pointed. Normally, there are between 7 to 11 lobes on each leaf of a Red Oak,
            and these leaves can vary in size, with large leaves growing up to 9 inches long!

            Red Oak bark is usually (unsurprisingly) red in color but has lines of silver that run through the bark.
            As the tree ages, fisures form which appear as "cracks" in the tree. These cracks contribute to the scaly
            appearance of the Red Oak.

            <strong>Red Oak trees have multiple ways of reproducing.</strong> 
            A Red Oak tree is actually able to reproduce in two different ways: through seeds and through it's roots.
            Reproduction through seeds is the most common form of reproduction among plants, and little has to be explained about it.
            But, how Red Oaks can also reproduce is by roots which is essentially when a new shoot of the tree starts growing 
            up from the roots.

            Although many people confuse Red Oaks with White Oaks, the key difference comes with their 
            leaf shapes! The Red Oak has leaves that are pointed at their lobes, while the white oak has
            no points and is entirely curvey. Each leaf usually contains 7 to 9 lobes, and each leaf can grow
            to be about 5 inches long.

            <strong>The bark of a White Oak is very intriguing.</strong>
            White Oak bark, unlike Red Oaks which just has the appearance of it, is actually broken into scales.
            This is due to the fact that as the tree ages, it grows furrows, which then break into scales. Oftentimes, 
            when you look closey at a White Oak, you can find patches of bark that are entirely smooth, and that is where
            recent scales have fallen off of the bark to make way for the new wood underneath.

            <strong>White Oak Bark actually serves many purposes.</strong> 
            For centuries, people have been using the bark of White Oaks for its medicinal qualities. White Oak bark
            can be made into a tea that is used to treat various illnesses such as arthritis, diarrhea, and fevers. 
            Other cultures have used White Oak bark in a compress and rubbed it onto areas of swelling in an attempt to
            stop inflammation. Unlike the Red Oak which gets its name from its bark, the White Oak gets
            its name because during the summer and spring seasons, the underside of the leaves appears to be a white-ish green color.

            white color of the bottoms of the leaves. The common name for the tree, Swamp White Oak, was named after
            the tree's preference for swampy and humid environments.
