              <strong>The American Elm is the perfect example of a ridged teardrop leaf. </strong>
              The leaves of the American Elm are a medium sized leaf, growing between 4 to 6 inches long. 
              The perimeter of the leaf is entirely ridged. Each life is a waxy dark green on one side 
              and then a much lighter shade of green on the flip side, making a start contrast between the two.

              get sick and suffer pandemics. One example is Dutch Elm Disease, which is very efficient at 
              killing off Elm Trees. Before the spread of the disease, American Elms could live up to 200 
              years old, but now they rarely live past 30!

              When put side by side, these two leaves share many of the same characteristics; they both

              Although the bark of the English Elm looks to be similar to many other species of

              from a disease known as the Dutch Elm Disease, which is extremely efficient at killing American Elms 
              and shortening their lifespans signficantly. Amazingly, the English Elm is very good at fighting off 
              Dutch Elm Disease, which means that it has continued to grow and thrive throughout history as other 
              species of Elms have died off. The canopy of an English Elm can grow as wide as 50 feet, which made these 
              trees extremely popular for shade trees in old fields.

              have "teeth" along their perimeter which give the leaf a spiky look. The American Beech on the other hand,

              A "Double Toothed" leaf means a leaf that has larger teeth along the perimeter and then each tooth

              The cycle of the Silver Birch Tree is one of the most famous cycles observed by trees. 
              During the Birch Tree's infancy, the bark is extremely smooth, making a beautiful white canvas 
              of the tree. Then as the tree develops, the bark begins to become extremely flaky and thin layers of

              <strong>Birch Trees served as one of the earliest forms of paper. </strong> 
              Since the tree naturally undergoes a shedding cycle where it loses its extremely 
              thin white bark, it became an obvious choice for early humans to write things on. 
              The danger of this was then that humans who wanted to use Birch Bark as paper would rip 
              the thin bark off of the tree, which greatly damages the tree and can even kill it.

              <strong>Not only are Hornbeam leaves ridged, they also have hairs along their perimeters.</strong>
              As said in the Silver Birch leaf description, the jagged edges of the leaf are not for protection 
              of the plant, but rather have a biological reason. The different edges allow for more water to be 
              evaporated out of the leaf, which is important for trees that prefer warmer climates. But, while the 
              ridged edges are not for defense, the hairs on the leaf are! The hairs on the leaf are there so that 
              little bugs that land on the leaf get the hairs stuck in them like needles and large animals who eat the 
              leaves get annoying hairs stuck to the inside of their mouths.

              White Oak bark, unlike Red Oaks which just has the appearance of it, is actually broken into scales.
              This is due to the fact that as the tree ages, it grows furrows, which then break into scales. Oftentimes, 
              when you look closey at a White Oak, you can find patches of bark that are entirely smooth, and that is where
              recent scales have fallen off of the bark to make way for the new wood underneath.

              For centuries, people have been using the bark of White Oaks for its medicinal qualities. White Oak bark
              can be made into a tea that is used to treat various illnesses such as arthritis, diarrhea, and fevers. 
              Other cultures have used White Oak bark in a compress and rubbed it onto areas of swelling in an attempt to
              stop inflammation. Unlike the Red Oak which gets its name from its bark, the White Oak gets
              its name because during the summer and spring seasons, the underside of the leaves appears to be a white-ish green color.

              <strong>The Scarlet Oak has similar to the Red Oak, with some key differences. </strong>
              Unlike the previous two trees, the lobes on the Scarlet Oak are pointed. The Scarlet Oak leaves 
              mostly all have 7 lobes, with very few containing 9. These leaves can grow between 4 and 7 inches.
              To tell Scarlet Oak and Red Oak leaves apart, you can look at the spaces between the lobes as Scarlet
              Oaks have a much more drastic indent between lobes as opposed to the Red Oak.

              Similar to the rest of the oak family, the Scarlet Oak develops furrows as it ages. But, unlike other 
              species in the family, these furrows are not very deep and instead remain rather close to the surface. 
              The inner bark between the furrows is a pink color when the tree is young, and as the tree ages this 
              inner bark turns orange.

            <strong>The Scarlet Oak is a very resilient tree. </strong> 
              The Scarlet Oak has adapted to grow in dry environments. The tree can grow along ridges and slopes with
              an elaborate root system. Because of this extensive root system, it means several things for the tree:
              For one, the tree is much harder to uproot because of it's ability to grow along ridges. For another thing,
              the Scarlet Oak is able to survive droughts much better than other trees because its elaborate trunk allows
              for optimal water storage.

              <strong>The Shingle Oak is the only oak in Harvard Yard that does not have lobed leaves. </strong>
              For that reason, it is easily distinguishable from other oaks. 
              The leaves are teardrop shaped, smooth and shiny on the top, and around 4 to 6 inches long. Usually dark green,
              but in autumn, they change to a dark red, before eventually falling off of the branches.

              It is light brown, scaly, and tough, with the inside wood being reddish brown.
              When the Shingle Oak is young, the bark is extremely soft and smooth with a light
              green color, like a Pin Oak. But as the tree grows, the bark begins to grow very deep 
              brown furrows, which become prominent scales just like a Red or White Oak.

              They are usually alternately arranged, around 3 inches long, with a beautful natural gloss and dark green hue. 
              However, in the fall, this green changes to an intense red with a multi-color array of hues of yellow, orange, and purple.
              One way to tell the difference between a Black Gum and a Sweet Gum tree is by their leaves, which are generally very different 
              in shape and size, even though they belong in the same genus.

              <strong> Black Gum bark is very distinct. </strong>
               It is  medium-gray, furrowed, with aggressively large ridges; with age, all of these aspects of the tree
                become more and more prominent. Often, Black Gum bark is compared to very darkly colored alligator scales,
