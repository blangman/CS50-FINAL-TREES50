### DESIGNING AND PRESENTING RESEARCH ### 
For the Presentation of the trees and their facts, we knew that we wanted to break the presentation into multiple segments to make the information for palatable. We then decided that a good way to break up the infomation would be to present information about the leaves of each tree, the bark, and a fun fact about the tree. 

# How to present the information # 
After we decided what information we wanted to convey to the user, we needed to decide on the implimentation behind it. That's when we decided that using a bootstrap accordion function would be the best option because it allows the user to interact with only the information that they want to deal with rather than being bombarded with paragraph after paragraph. Also, an accordion system for each tree was a good system because it meant that each tree's div did not need to take up too much space when the accordion was closed. We also wanted the user to be able to see images of the tree, leaves, and bark that we were teaching them about, so we decided on a way to display the image of the tree on the left hand side while the accordion is on the right. Within the accordion we added images for the leaves and bark respectively. These design decisions were done so that the user could be able to access both the visuals as well as the information in a palatable manner. 
Once we decided on a format for how to present each tree, we used that for every tree in our database. This part involved many hours of research in which we found information on every individual tree's leaves, bark, and information. Although the format of each tree is displayed in the same way, each tree has a unique accordion id which makes it so that when you open an accordion, only that one accordion opens.
